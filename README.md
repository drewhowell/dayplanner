# Day Planner

## Purpose
Poor time management can result in missed meetings and deadlines or create the appearance of unprofessionalism. A daily planner allows employees to see their day at a glance, schedule time effectively, and improve productivity.

## Description
This program is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot represent one hour and contain the following: The time of day, a field to hold the user's input,  a save button. Clicking on the save button stores the time and user's input in localStorage.

Near the top of the calendar, the application displays the current day. Additionally, each hour is color-coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. These colors change depending on the time of day.

This app uses the Moment.js library to work with date and time.
